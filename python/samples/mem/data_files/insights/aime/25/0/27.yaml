insight: "First, write each term as x_k = m_k/n_k in lowest terms. The given recurrence
  x_{k+1} = (1/3)( x_k + 1/x_k - 1 )
  shows that the unsimplified numerator and denominator are
  A_k = m_k^2 + n_k^2 - m_k n_k,  B_k = 3 m_k n_k.
  One checks that gcd(A_k, B_k) = 3 at each step, so after canceling that factor:
    m_{k+1} = A_k/3,  n_{k+1} = m_k * n_k,
  with (m_1, n_1) = (25, 11).

  To find (m_{2025} + n_{2025}) mod 1000, note that working modulo 1000 gives:
    m_{k+1} ≡ (m_k^2 + n_k^2 - m_k n_k) * 3^{-1} (mod 1000),
    n_{k+1} ≡ m_k * n_k (mod 1000),
  where the inverse of 3 modulo 1000 is 667.
  A simple computer iteration then yields
    m_{2025} ≡ 673,  n_{2025} ≡ 575 (mod 1000),
  so their sum ≡ 673 + 575 = 1248 ≡ 248 (mod 1000).
  Answer: 248."
